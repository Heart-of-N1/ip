# 550W Chatbot

A chatbot meticulously crafted through countless sleepless nights, fueled by an unyielding passion for CS2113 and an endless supply of coffee, all while stationed before a 14-inch screen.

Hello from:

## How to run it?

Good thing that you asked.

Simply download the ip.jar file. Then run by right-clicking and selecting "open in terminal".
Then type in the following:
	java -jar ip.jar
It should start the application right away.

## How to use it?

Good thing that you also asked.

This chatbot contains **some** basic functions to document and keep track of tasks.

To do so, simply type in the following:
- **To store "todo" type events:** todo [event description]
- **To store "event" type events:** event [event description] /from [yyyy-MM-dd HHmm] /to [yyyy-MM-dd HHmm]
- **To store "deadline" type events:** deadline [event description] /by [yyyy-MM-dd HHmm]
- **To list all events:** list
- **To mark an event by its index in the list:** mark [index]
- **To unmark an event by its index in the list:** unmark [index]
- **To delete an event by its index in the list:** delete [index]
- **To find events by keyword:** find [keyword]
- **To exit the chatbot:** bye

The list may or may not expand in the future. It depends on if I have enough time to finish the EE2026 project or not. Which I heard will take a lot, a lot, a lot of time.

## How to store it?

Good thing that you also also asked.

Guess what? Every event you input will be stored via magic in a text file known as "duke.txt". It is right beside the ip.jar file.

If this is the first time you run ip.jar or, you accidentally deleted the duke.txt file, it is ok. When the jar file is run it will automatically create one in the default directory.

## Any pre-requisite?

Java, i guess? Preferably java 11.
